## Overview

The goal of this lab is to introduce the concept of baseline models and their role in helping us determine if taking the time to build a detailed predictive model is worth while. Baseline models can also play an important role in setting benchmarks.  

## Instructions

After creating your own GitHub repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L07_baseline_models.html`. A template is also provided (rename as `lastname_firstname_L07.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
