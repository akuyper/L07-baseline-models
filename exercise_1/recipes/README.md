## Overview

Directory contains recipe/preprocessing/feature engineering for the various models to be fitted/trained. They are created in [exercise_1/2_recipes_ex1.R](https://github.com/akuyper/L07-baseline-models/blob/main/exercise_1/2_recipes_ex1.R)

- `abalone_recipe_lm`: recipe/preprocessing for linear models (e.g. basic multiple regression, elastic net/penalized regression)
- `abalone_recipe_tree`: recipe/preprocessing for tree based models (e.g. random forest, boosted tree)
